# Samantha learns

**Soul Designer:** [@kafischer](https://github.com/kafischer)

This soul, named Samantha, is designed to provoke the speaker and learn about them. It is modeled with a bit of an edge, and quite informal.

The soul is composed of several mental processes:
- `initialProcess`: a simple process that speaks to the user with a bit of an edge
- `learnsAboutTheUser`: builds up a world model of the user over time, sometimes surfacing thoughts back to the main process

The source code for these processes can be found in the `./soul` directory.
