# WorkingMemory Regions

WorkingMemory has the concept of memory regions which are a light weight way to update and order working memory in manipulable sections (think core memory, or conversational summary, etc).

```
WorkingMemory regions
+--------------------+
|      Core          |
+--------------------+
|     Summary        |
+--------------------+
|     default        |
+--------------------+
```

A simple example is keeping the core region at the front of `WorkingMemory` updated:

```ts
let workingMemory = new WorkingMemory({ soulName: 'Alice' })

workingMemory = workingMemory.withMemory({
  role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.User,
  content: "Hello!",
})

let withCore = workingMemory.withRegion("core", {
  role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.core,
  content: "You are a helpful assistant",
})
// withCore will now have 2 working memories, with "core" at the beginning
// of the memories list (since regions default to the beginning)

withCore = workingMemory.withRegion("core", {
  role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.core,
  content: "You are a an evil henchman",
})
// now the helpful assistant message has been replaced by the evil henchman memory
```


## Ordering Regions

Keep your various regions ordered using the `orderRegions` function. Any memories not marked as part of a region are part of the 'default' region.

```ts
let workingMemory = new WorkingMemory({ soulName: 'Alice' })

workingMemory = workingMemory.withMemory({
  role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.User,
  content: `Interlocutor said: "Hello!"`,
})

const withCore = workingMemory.withRegion("core", {
  role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.core,
  content: "You are a helpful assistant",
})
// withcore will now have 2 working memories, with "core" at the
// beginning of the memories list (since regions default to the beginning)

const withSummary = withCore.withRegion("summary", {
  role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.Assistant,
  content: "This is a summary",
})
// summary is added to the front of the working memory by default too
// now the memory would look like:
/**
WorkingMemory regions
+--------------------+
|     summary        |
+--------------------+
|      core          |
+--------------------+
|     default        |
+--------------------+
*/


const orderedMemory = withSummary.orderRegions("core", "summary", "default")
// the orderedMemory WorkingMemory now has the core region first, followed by summary, followed by the Hello!
/**
WorkingMemory regions
+--------------------+
|      core          |
+--------------------+
|      summary       |
+--------------------+
|     default        |
+--------------------+
*/


const reverseOrderd = withSummary.orderRegios("default", "summary", "core")
// now reverseOrderd starts with the hello, followed by summary and the last memory is the core message.
/**
WorkingMemory regions
+--------------------+
|      default       |
+--------------------+
|      summary       |
+--------------------+
|        core        |
+--------------------+
*/

```

## Removing Regions

You can remove entire regions of the memory using the `removeRegions` function.

```ts
let workingMemory = new WorkingMemory({ soulName: 'Alice' })
workingMemory = workingMemory.withMonologue("Alice thought to herself about flowers.")

const withImpulses = workingMemory.withRegion("impulses", {
  role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.System,
  content: `Alice thought: "I like to tip objects off of high counter-tops"`,
})
const withoutImpulses = workingMemory.withoutRegions("impulses")

// withoutImpulses is now a working memory with only the monologue in it
```
