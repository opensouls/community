    The Soul Engine is a total solution for typescript developers looking to give their AIs capabilities beyond simple turn taking with GPT. The Engine provides a remote execution environment, plus framework, plus debugger, that is an all-in-one hosted and scalable solution for developers looking to program and debug how their AIs think, feel, remember, and act. Think NextJS + Vercel for the minds of digital beings.

    The Engine is designed such that it takes under 30 seconds to deploy AI that 10s of thousands of users can interact with. Yet, the Engine runtime is programmable, and infinitely extensible, with powerful built-in-features like resumable conversations,  fully debuggable memory, integrated vector store solutions with atomic change tracking, multi-model (and multi-modal) support, and background processes for long running computations.

## 💫 AI Souls
AI Souls are agentic and embodied digital beings, one day comprising thousands of mental processes (managed by the Soul Engine). Unlike traditional chatbots, your code gives AI souls personality, drive, ego, and agency. AI Souls interact with people (and each other) in a highly humane way, creating warm, interesting, and engaging experiences.

Folks building on the engine have creating souls that:
* bring characters from their IP to life
* interact on their discord
* are present with them in AR
* teach kids
* reside in games
* and so much more...

1. Run the samantha-learns soul
```bash
npx soul-engine init samantha-learns
# then CD into the samantha-learns example soul.
cd samantha-learns
# and npm install
npm install
# and then run samantha
npx soul-engine dev
```

Those commands will open your web browser and you can chat with Samantha. Open up the samantha-learns directory in a code editor and try customizing the soul by modifying the `Samantha.md` file.
