# Perception Processor

The perception processor is an optional, powerful, advanced tool to control how working memory is added to your soul upon receiving new perceptions.
The Soul Engine comes with a default `PerceptionProcessor` so you don't need to worry about this if your soul doesn't have a need.

However, for some advanced cases the `PerceptionProcessor` is a great tool. For example, if you want to have the known name of the interloctutor saved into working memory instead of "interlocutor said: ..." the working memory could become "Donny said: ..." The `PerceptionProcessor` is also useful in cases where you might not want to store every single perception to working memory, but instead do some pre-processing to that perception.

The `PerceptionProcessor` function takes in an object containing three properties as its input:
1. `perception`: This is the incoming perception that needs to be processed. It contains details about the event or data that the soul has perceived.
2. `workingMemory`: This represents the current state of the soul's memory. It is where the processed perceptions are stored.
3. `currentProcess`: This is the current mental process that the soul is executing. It can be used to modify the flow of mental processes based on the perception.

The output of the `PerceptionProcessor` is a tuple containing:
1. The updated `workingMemory` after the perception has been processed and potentially added to it.
2. An optional `MentalProcess` which can be the same as the input if no change is needed, or a new process if the perception dictates a change in the soul's mental processing.
3. The optional params to pass to the new `MentalProcess`

You can also return `undefined` from the perceptionProcessor and no additional processing will occur (and nothing will be added to the working memory).

You can use all of available hooks in your `perceptionProcessor`.

## Example

In this example, we'll use the soul memory to update the name of the interlocutor if it's available (presumably set in a different `MentalProcess`).

```ts filename="soul/perceptionProcessor.ts"
import { ChatMessageRoleEnum, InputMemory, Memory, PerceptionProcessor, useActions, useSoulMemory } from "@opensouls/engine"

function safeName(name?: string) {
  return (name || "").replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_-{}]/g, '_').slice(0, 62);
}

const perceptionProcessor: PerceptionProcessor = async ({ perception, workingMemory, currentProcess }) => {
  const { log } = useActions()
  const userName = useSoulMemory("userName", "")

  log("perception processor ran")

  const name = userName.current ? userName.current : perception.name

  const content = `${name} ${perception.action}: ${perception.content}`

  const memory: InputMemory = {
    role: perception.internal ? ChatMessageRoleEnum.Assistant : ChatMessageRoleEnum.User,
    content,
    ...(name ? { name: safeName(name) } : {}),
    metadata: {
      ...perception._metadata,
      timestamp: perception._timestamp
    }
  }

  workingMemory = workingMemory.withMemory(memory)

  return [workingMemory, currentProcess]
}

export default perceptionProcessor
```
