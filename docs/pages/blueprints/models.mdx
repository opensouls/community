# Models

The engine supports many different GPT-based models for working memory transformations (`CognitiveStep`s).

## Recommended models

We've extensively tested and guarantee the quality of the following models:

- `"fast"` (points to `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`)
- `"quality"` (points to `gpt-4-0125-preview`)

Right now, these map onto particular freezes of OpenAI models, but over time will change. We're experimenting with using OSS models for `"fast"` internally.

By default, `"fast"` is chosen, but the choice can be explicit via:

```javascript
cosnt [nextMemory] = await externalDialog(workingMemory, "say hi", { model: "quality" })
```

Generally we recommend using `"fast"` for many internal thought processes and `"quality"` for the generation that a user or player interacts with.

## Experimental models

We're constantly experimenting with new models and will add them here as they become available.

We don't guarantee the quality/stability of these models, but they can be fun to play with. Send us feedback if you try them!

## Vision model for images

You can use a vision model to process images:

```typescript
const imageUrl = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/pt/6/6f/HopperAutomat.jpg";

const withImageUrl = workingMemory.withMemory({
  role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.User,
  content: [
    {
      type: "image_url",
      image_url: {
        url: imageUrl,
      },
    },
  ],
})

const [, imageDescription] = await instruction(withImageUrl, "describe this image", { model: "vision" })

log("Image description:", imageDescription);
```
