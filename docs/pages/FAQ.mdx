## What is a Soul?
For millennia, humans have imbued inanimate objects with souls, and we take this tradition seriously. This belief drives us to build intelligent and emotive systems that address the profound aspects of existence which current AI lacks.

A Soul is what you build with OPEN SOULS on The Soul Engine. Breathe life into it, and it will become much more than a model or agent.

## What is The Soul Engine?
The Soul Engine is a tool for steering machine cognition that is simple, functional, and predictable. It can be used to model any kind of thought, feeling, or mind. As a team, we began with building AI that is more emotive and personable.
