# Pricing

> Designing a mind is an inherently complex task, but understanding individual components of the Soul Engine should be straightforward.

    At Open Souls, we believe that pricing should be simple, transparent, and fair. Our goal is to make the incredible power of AI souls accessible to as many developers and creators as possible.

    We've designed our pricing model with a few key principles in mind:

    1. **Simplicity**: Pricing should be easy to understand. You shouldn't need a PhD to figure out your bill. 

    2. **Transparency**: There should be no hidden fees or surprise charges. What you see is what you get.

    3. **Fairness**: Pricing should scale with usage. Small projects should be affordable, while larger projects can grow without breaking the bank.

## Credits 
Technology evolves rapidly. We require flexibility to provide you with the best experience at the best price. We use a credit system to allow you to pay-per-use and offer you the best prices as we grow. 

### Conversion
During our Alpha, our formula for converting credits to dollars is:
> 1 credit = $1

Simple!

### Usage Calculation
We add a nominal markup to our costs in order to fund continued improvements to our technology. Here's how we calculate credit usage:

- **LLM calls**: 1x + 0.75% proxy fee
  - We add a 0.75% proxy fee to cover the cost of our networking infrastructure.
  - Otherwise, we pass through the cost of the LLM API call.
- **Storage**: 0.15 credits/gigabtye
  - Storage is cheap! We transfer that savings to our customers.
  - We add a fee to cover the cost of Databases, Backups, and Object Storage.
- **Execution time**: ??? //TODO: Coming in the next revision



## Tiers
We offer three tiers of service, designed to accomodate projects of any size, from hobbyists to large enterprises. 

### Free
- 25 credits
- Support in Discord
- Access to weekly Soul Hours

Every user gets $25 worth of credits immediately upon signing up. No credit card, no waitlist, no problem.

By signing up, you'll gain access to Discord, where our staff is happy to support you via public channels.

You'll also gain access to Soul Hours, the weekly live virtual event hosted by our team where we answer your questions.

### Pay what you want
- Everything in **Free**
- Priority Support

With our "Pay what you want" subscription offering, you gain access to Priority Support in Discord through our private, dedicated channel. That means faster response times, more in-depth responses, and more personalized attention from our team.

You can buy credits directly from us at any time, in any amount, from $5 to $2000. You can also set up a recurring monthly purchase if you'd like to automatically top off your credits each month. This is a great way to support Open Souls and ensure you always have enough credits to power your projects.

### Enterprise
If you have a larger-scale project (like Movies or Games) and know you'll need features like:

- Service Level Agreement (SLA)
- Dedicated support
- Uncapped usage

We are more than happy to support your use case! Reach out to [sales@opensouls.com](mailto:sales@opensouls.com) to tell us more about your project.
