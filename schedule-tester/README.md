# Samantha schedules an event

**Soul Designer:** [@tobowers](https://github.com/tobowers)

This soul is designed to demonstrate a followup, scheduled event. Samantha tells the user she's gonna poke them and then she does.

The soul is composed of a single mental processes:
- `pokesSpeaker`: a simple process that tells the user they are going to poke them, and then pokes them a little bit later.

The source code for these processes can be found in the `./src` directory.
