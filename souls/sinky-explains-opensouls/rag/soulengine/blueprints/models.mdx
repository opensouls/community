# Models

The engine supports two different GPT-based models for working memory transformations (`CognitiveStep`s):

- `"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"`
- `"gpt-4-0125-preview"`

Right now, these map onto particular freezes of OpenAI models, but over time will change. We're experimenting with using OSS models for `"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"` internally.

By default, `"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"` is chosen, but the choice can be explicit via:

```javascript
step = await step.next(..., { model: "gpt-4-0125-preview" })
```

Generally we recommend using `"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"` for many internal thought processes and `"gpt-4-0125-preview"` for the generation that a user or player interacts with.
