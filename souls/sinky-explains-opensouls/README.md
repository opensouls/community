# Sinky uses everything

**Soul Designer:** [@tobowers](https://github.com/tobowers)

Sinky is a work in progress. The goal is to use all the features of the SOUL ENGINE in one semi-coherent soul.

## Run this soul

In this directory run

```bash
npx soul-engine rag push ./rag
```

then

```bash
npx soul-engine dev
```
