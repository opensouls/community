          ## Description
          Write an updated and clear set of notes on the user that thing that the user wants to name.

          ## Rules
          * Keep descriptions as bullet points
          * Keep relevant bullet points from before
          * Use abbreviated language to keep the notes short
          * Do not write any notes about ${name}

          Please reply with the updated notes on the thing the user wants to name:'
        `
