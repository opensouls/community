# Alfred Learns Your Name

**Soul Designer:** [@tobowers](https://github.com/tobowers)

Alfred demonstrates the use of a perceptionProcessor to modify how working memories are saved based on perceptions.
He tries to learn your name, and once he does, instead of "interlocutor" saved in the working memory, the actual user's name is saved.
