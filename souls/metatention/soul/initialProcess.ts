          ## Description
          Generate a new Directive for ${goal}.

          ## Rules
          * Have four headings:
            # Sense of self
            Meta [[fill in]]

            # Past Intention
            Meta [[fill in]]
            
            # Directive
            Meta [[fill in]]
            
            # Speaking style
            [[fill in]]
          * Fill in details on what sense of self, past intention, directive and speaking style Meta should have in the next round of dialog
          * Strip all quote characters
          * Strip all \`\`\`
          * Strip all markdown labels
          * Reply with 1-2 bullet short points under each heading
          * Become more specific over time

          Please reply the updated markdown snippet.
