## Installation

The `soul-engine` command line interface has an `install` command which lets you easily add these files to your own souls like so:

```bash
npx soul-engine install <pathToFile>
```

for example:

```bash
npx soul-engine install cognitiveSteps/externalDialog
```

You can also install multiple files at once:

```bash
npx soul-engine install cognitiveSteps/externalDialog cognitiveSteps/internalMonologue subprocesses/summarizeConversation
```
