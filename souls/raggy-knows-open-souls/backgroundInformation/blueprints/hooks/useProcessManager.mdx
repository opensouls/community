# useProcessManager

The `useProcessManager` hook provides access to an API for managing the current `MentalProcess` of the soul.

```typescript filename="exampleProcess.ts" {1,5}
import { useProcessManager } from "@opensouls/engine";
import aDifferentMentalProcess from "./mentalProcesses/aDifferentMentalProcess"

const manageProcess: MentalProcess = async ({ workingMemory }) => {
  const { previousMentalProcess, invocationCount, wait } = useProcessManager();

  console.log(`Coming from aDifferentMentalProcess?`, previousMentalprocess === aDifferentMentalProcess);
  console.log(`Invocation Count: ${invocationCount}`);

  await wait(500); // wait for 500 ms

  // Continue with the rest of the mental process logic
  // ...

  return workingMemory;
};

export default manageProcess;
```

## async wait(numberOfMiliseconds: number)

`wait` is an asynchronous function that pauses the execution of the current mental process
for the specified number of milliseconds.

```javascript
await wait(1000) // wait 1 second
```

## previousMentalProcess

`previousMentalProcess` holds a _reference_ to the mental process that was executed before the current one. This is particularly useful for managing state transitions and understanding the flow of mental processes within a soul. By accessing `previousMentalProcess`, developers can make decisions based on what the soul was previously thinking or doing, allowing for more nuanced and context-aware mental process management.

If the current mental process has been invoked more than once the previousMentalProcess will continue to hold a reference to the older (different) mental process. If this mental process is the initialProcess then previousMentalProcess is `undefined`.

## invocationCount

The `invocationCount` is a number that represents the count of invocations of a mental process

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
The invocation count resets whenever the soul transitions to a new `MentalProcess`.
</Callout>

## Putting it all together

Here's an example process that makes use of the `invocationCount` and a switch into a different mentalProcess in order to define a compelling stateful behavior:

```javascript filename="provokesSpeaker.js"
import { MentalProcess, useProcessManager, useActions } from "@opensouls/engine";
import { brainstorm, decision, externalDialog, mentalQuery } from "./lib/cognitiveSteps.js";
import playsVictim from "./playsVictim.js";

const provokesSpeaker: MentalProcess = async ({ workingMemory }) => {
  const { speak } = useActions()
  const { invocationCount } = useProcessManager()

  let response;
  // compute a line of dialog
  [workingMemory, response] = await externalDialog(workingMemory, "Try to provoke the speaker")
  speak(response)

  // decide if it's time to move on
  const [, didProvokeTheUser] = await mentalQuery(workingMemory, "Has samantha successfully provoked the speaker?")


  // move to a new mental process if the soul decides it's time to move on
  // and it's not the first invocation
  if (didProvokeTheUser && invocationCount > 0) {
    // schedule the next mental process via reference to playsVictim
    return [workingMemory, playsVictim]
  }

  return workingMemory
}

export default provokesSpeaker
```
