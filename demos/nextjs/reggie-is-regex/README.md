Reggie The Regex
=================

Reggie is a living regular expression with regex-istential questions.

Reggie also demonstrates how to hook up a nextjs site to a soul.

The [soul](./soul/) directory contains reggie himself.
The [web](./web/) directory contains a nextjs app which has a [SoulProvider](./web/src/components/SoulProvider.tsx) to hook up to Reggie.

Getting started:
`npx soul-engine dev` in this directory.

Follow the [README](./web/README.md) in the web directory
and then:
`cd web && npm run dev` in the web directory.
